# Deploying a Spring Boot Application to AWS API Gateway via Elastic Beanstalk

This README provides detailed instructions on how to deploy a Spring Boot application to AWS API Gateway using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This setup allows you to create a scalable and easily accessible API for your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Spring Boot application (source code).
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create Elastic Beanstalk environments and API Gateway configurations.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prepare Your Spring Boot Application

1. Ensure that your Spring Boot application is correctly configured and running on your local machine.

### 2. Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment

### 2. Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application

1. Open the AWS Management Console.

2. Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.

3. Click "Create Application."

4. Follow the setup wizard to create your application. This includes specifying the application name and environment type.

### 3. Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment

1. In the Elastic Beanstalk console, select your newly created application.

2. Click "Create Environment."

3. Choose a web server environment and configure settings such as the instance type, environment name, key pair, and more.

4. During environment creation, upload your Spring Boot application's JAR/WAR file.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Elastic Beanstalk environment's configuration, go to "Configuration."

2. Add environment properties and database configurations as required. These values will be injected into your Spring Boot application.

### 5. Deploy Your Application

1. Once your environment is created and configured, click "Deploy" to start deploying your Spring Boot application.

2. Monitor the deployment process in the Elastic Beanstalk console.

### 6. Access Your Application

1. After a successful deployment, you can access your application using the environment's URL provided in the Elastic Beanstalk console.

### 7. Configure AWS API Gateway

1.	Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2.	Navigate to the API Gateway service.
3.	Create a new API by following the API Gateway wizard.
4.	Define your API's resources and methods to map your application's endpoints.
5.	Configure the integration with your Elastic Beanstalk environment as the backend for your API.
6.	Deploy your API to create a stage.

### 8 . Test with Postman
1.	Launch Postman.
2.	Import the provided Postman collection and environment, or create your own requests.
3.	Set the API Gateway URL as a variable in your Postman environment.
4.	Send requests to your API endpoints to test the functionality.

### Accessing Your API
1.	Once your Spring Boot application is deployed on Elastic Beanstalk and integrated with API Gateway:
2.	Retrieve the API Gateway URL from the AWS Management Console.
3.	Access your API endpoints using this URL, e.g., https://your-api-gateway-url/your-endpoint
